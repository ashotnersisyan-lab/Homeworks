### Docker Compose Construction
I created two dockerfiles for two images to later use two containers. 
One for the MlFlow Server and one for the python training.
Their work is dictated by the docker-compose.yml file that is in this directory

Run this command in the current directory to run the docker-compose file:
```bash
    docker-compose up
```

It will run both containers and perform the training of the ML models. 
The results can be observed in the MlFlow UI.

### Details of the ML training model.
The training is based on the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

I used two different sets of features that are generated by two preprocessing functions.
I used three models Logistic Regression, SVM and CatBoost. 
For each of the combination of the preprocessing methods and the predictive algorithm 
a model is trained, the best hyperparameters are chosen by hyperopt. 

All the models, parameters and accuracy metrics are loaded to MlFlow for model comparison.
The different features are also loaded as parameter with string value that has description in it.
